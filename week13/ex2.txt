1. Recovery
When this technique is used,
the system does not attempt to prevent deadlocks from occurring. Instead, it lets
them occur, tries to detect when this happens, and then takes some action to
recover after the fact. 
a) Preemption
b) Rollback
c) Killing processes

2. Avoidance
The system must be
able to decide whether granting a resource is safe or not and make the allocation
only when it is safe.

3. Prevention
If we can ensure that at least
one of conditions of deadlocks is never satisfied, then deadlocks will be structurally impossible
a) Mutual-Exclusion Condition
b) Hold-and-Wait Condition
c) No-Preemption Condition
d) Circular Wait Condition


If we can exlude one of conditions of deadlock, it is better to use prevention.
Otherwise, we can use avoidance, but it will cause much harder scheduling of resources usage
for software developers, because system has to know, when which resource is needed.
If we can't satisfy both of these, we can use recovery, but all three ways to recover are
not stable and can damage information.
